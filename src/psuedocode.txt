Main method
    give port number // 63342
    host name variable = args[0]
    server socket variable (portNumber)

    continuous loop // used to constatnly check if there is a connection on that specific port when running
        client socket = the server socket being accepted

        // get the output of the client socket
        PrintWriter variable
            /*
            "PrintWriter(OutputStream out, boolean autoFlush)"
            OutputStream refers to the variable, and then the boolean, should be set to true because it ensures that every
            line of text is sent immediately. it is terminated by a newline character (/n)
            */

        // get the input of the client socket
        BufferedReader variable
            /*
            "BufferedReader(Reader in)"
            e.g. BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(clientSocket.getInputStream()));
            */

        // how to communicate the message back
        conditional branch where if a connection is recieved, send a message back
